# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
To aid Louise plan her campaign for it to have a successful outcome

### Purpose
 To provide insights to Louise regarding how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Analyzed how different campaigns under the Theater category fared based on Launch dates. This could help Louise in planning when to launch her planning for the best possible outcome.
Analyzed how different campaigns fared in relation to their funding goals. This could help Louise in planning the optimum goal amount to minimize the risk of campaign failure.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater outcomes were more successful starting May - Jun - July and progressively the success drecreased over the year. This indicates that theater campaigns are expected to be more successful during the summer holiday season and hence that time should be targeted to launch successful theater campaign by Louise.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The camapaigns with a lower goal amount were most successful for plays subcategory and progressively shows the trend towards failure as the goal amount increases. However, we see an inflection point at a goal amount between 25000 to 29999 from where the success starts to see a steady increase. The campaigns maintain a steady success trend from a goal anount between 35000 to 44999 and that maybe the optimum goal amount for planning the campaign.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The two visuals are not sufficient to decide the overall success outcome of the campaign. There should be other factors like total duration of the campaign and the actual amount made by the campaign againts the goal. 

The Outcome Based on Launch Date has the failure line in such a manner that it does not look to be directly related to the time when the campaign is launched. Hence there seems to be some additional factor affecting the failure of the campaign.

If we look into Outcome Based on Goals visual, these two parameters are not at all sufficient to decide the actual goal amount. Looking at the way the campagns success reaches a steady state at a higher goal value indicates that there is some other important parameter influnceing the outcome of the campaign.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theater outcomes were more sucecssful starting May - Jun - July and progressively the success drecreased over the year. This indicates that theater campaigns are expected to be more successful during the summer holiday season and hence that time should be targeted to launch successful theater campaign. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The camapaigns with a lower goal amount were most successful for plays subcategory and progressively shows the trend towards failure as the goal amount increases. However, we see an inflection point at a goal amount between 25000 to 29999 from where the success starts to see a steady increase. The campaigns maintain a steady success trend from a goal anount between 35000 to 44999 and that maybe the optimum goal amount for planning the campaign.
 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
As part of this exercise, enough dimensions have not been analyzed to give the true trend and behavior of data. Hence its diffiuclt to give Louise a definite answer to her question.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Graph to show outcome vs. duration of the campaign
Graph to show outcome vs. country in which the campaign was launched
